## B2C AI Solutions

In today's world of B2C AI Solutions, cutting-edge technology meet consumer needs! Artificial intelligence is transforming everything right from the way businesses 
interact with their customers, and B2C companies are no exception. With the help of AI solutions, businesses can now personalize their offerings, 
improve customer experience, and increase revenue. But how do these companies monetize their AI solutions? 
Well, that is our challenge for this task to find out ways to monetize the B2C AI Solutions.

## My Submission:

Here is my power point presentation for the monetization strategy for B2C AI Solutions. It is the link to the file uploaded in the repository. 

In this presentation, I have mentioned the various monetization strategies that can employed by anyone. And I have sorted the general list available publicly 
tailored to the specific need. I also suggest implementation of all methods in the order of product marketing where, in the first step we need to grab capital 
for building the product. One way to do that is to **CROWDFUNDING** (method 1). After gathering capital and completing the product building, we need to make 
public/customers aware of existence of the product. We can do that by giving free trails which can then be put a price to use for. This is known as **FREEMIUM** 
(method 2).  Then we can put in advertisements banners for other companies to **ADVERTISE** on our platform to make some commission amount (method 3). Then we can 
put in some small additional boost for sale within the platform which are know an **IN-APP PURCHASES** (method 4). Then we can make use of **E-COMMERCE** to list 
our service/platform as a product on ecommerce platforms like amazon, flipkart etc so that our services/platform reaches more people (method 5). Then we can 
approach some individuals for **AFFILIATE MARKETING** and help us get more customers (method 6). Last one is to conduct **CONFERENCES** on the topics of AI and 
collect entry fees from the participants (method 7).
